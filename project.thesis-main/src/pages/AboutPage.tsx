                History
              </h2>
              <p className="text-gray-600 mb-4">
                Albay has a rich history dating back to pre-colonial times. The
                province was established on March 10, 1917, although it had
                existed as a political unit since the Spanish colonial period.
                The name "Albay" is derived from the local word "Albay," meaning
                "to the volcano," referring to the iconic Mayon Volcano.
              </p>
              <p className="text-gray-600">
                Throughout its history, Albay has been shaped by volcanic
                eruptions, particularly from Mayon Volcano, which has erupted
                over 50 times since its first recorded eruption in 1616. The
                most destructive eruption occurred in 1814, which buried the
                town of Cagsawa, leaving only the bell tower of its church
                visible above the volcanic debris.
